## **Lead Cybersecurity & AI Architect&nbsp;|&nbsp;CEH AI&nbsp;|&nbsp;Tech Entrepreneur**

Welcome to my GitHub – I’m Eric Ariel Rimón, a Chief‑level architect who bridges deep technical mastery with entrepreneurial acumen. Over the past decade I’ve led both startups and enterprise security programmes, weaving cloud security, offensive AI and DevSecOps into scalable, secure‑by‑design systems that impress CISOs, CTOs and investors alike.  

### 🎯 **Executive Summary**
With 10 years in cyber‑security and artificial intelligence I’ve architected cutting‑edge products and mentored high‑performing teams. My experiences include: 

* **Cloud & SOC Automation:** Designing zero‑trust architectures, deploying Microsoft Sentinel, Azure and AWS stacks, and building intelligent playbooks that automatically triage and close incidents using LLMs. Automation rules in Microsoft Sentinel can triage new incidents, change their status, assign an owner, tag and even close resolved incidents【935991109219243†L219-L241】.
* **Offensive Security & AI:** Developing autonomous red‑team agents that perform reconnaissance, map CVEs and generate payloads. Proactive threat hunting reduces risk and aligns with security best practices.
* **GRC & Compliance:** Delivering cloud‑native compliance engines that continuously audit Azure and AWS environments against ISO 27001, generating evidence‑ready matrices.
* **AI Platform Engineering:** Building secure GenAI/LLM platforms that leverage Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) and adhere to privacy and data‑sovereignty requirements.

I translate these technical achievements into business growth by aligning cyber strategy with corporate objectives and investor relations. Executive communication, fundraising and strategic partnerships are part of my daily vocabulary.

### 🚀 **Featured Flagship Projects**
Below are four enterprise‑grade repositories that exemplify my expertise. Each repository has its own professional documentation and demonstrates secure coding practices, automation and scalability.  

| Project | Description |
|---|---|
| **[Sentinel‑AI‑AutoTriage](../Sentinel-AI-AutoTriage)** | Cloud‑native SOC automation framework. Connects to Microsoft Sentinel, ingests Tier‑1 incidents and uses an LLM API to analyse, enrich and auto‑close incidents. Uses Python, `azure‑identity` and `azure‑mgmt‑securityinsight`. |
| **[Autonomous‑RedAgent](../Autonomous-RedAgent)** | AI‑driven red‑team agent that automates reconnaissance, parses CVEs, maps attack vectors and generates payloads. Integrates Nmap, CVE feeds and LLM summarisation. |
| **[Cloud‑Compliance‑Engine‑ISO27001](../Cloud-Compliance-Engine-ISO27001)** | Infrastructure‑as‑Code and Python scripts that audit Azure/AWS environments and map controls directly to ISO/IEC 27001. Generates CSV and JSON compliance matrices. |
| **[Enterprise‑Sundai‑Bot](../Enterprise-Sundai-Bot)** | Sanitised showcase of a production‑grade AI bot that automates business operations, shift planning and ROI measurement. Built with FastAPI, vector stores and secure API deployment. |

### 🤝 **Connect & Collaborate**
I’m always interested in pioneering projects, advisory roles and speaking engagements. Feel free to reach out via LinkedIn or email to discuss how we can secure the future together.
